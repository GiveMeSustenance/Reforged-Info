        <h2 class="info-title">Uses</h2>
        <p>
            Wortox is usually run as a tank.
            He is more early game focused than other tanks like Winnona.
            His healing can help your team survive the early waves. 
            It also helps him survive solo (and since he blocks less do more damage) against Boarilla or Boarrior when your team has to focus on other mobs. 
            He is also run rarely as a meele dps since his healing can help the tank stay alive, 
                though this is less viable since dart dps are safer and the heal staff is usually enough healing.

        <h2 class="info-title">Perks</h2>
        <p>
            After dealing 200 dmg, Wortox heals 10 HP to all allies in his range (10).
            Each Wortox has a separate damage counter.
            Once one Wortox on the team triggers the heal the counter will be reset for every Wortox, so multiple on a team will not stack very effectivly.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="info-title">Builds</h2>
        <h3>Tank</h3>
        <p>
            Wortox usually prioritises damage gear to get as much team healing as possible.
            Stone Splint is optional, if you have another tank that wants it Wortox does fine acting as a second tank with damage armor or just wooden armor.
            if there is no Woodie you should tank the Boarilla since you can heal yourself. 
            To tank the Boarilla You should take the Steadfast Stone Armor, Gauntlets, and a damage hat if possible.  
            The final build is Steadfast Grand Armor, Blacksmiths Edge, and the Blossomed Wreath (Resplendent Nox Helm is also good until Swineclops).
        </p>

        <h3>DPS</h3>
        <p>
            DPS Wortox is not ideal since he has to be in melee range to do any damage.
            Wortox prioritises damage gear even more as DPS to create as much healing as possible.
            If possible you can do even more damage by taking Wigfrid's weapons (both starting and the Spiral Spear).
            For bosses you should be at the maximum possible melee range so you dont take agro, especially on Swineclops. 
            You may also want tankier gear since you'll likely get hit.
            The final build will likely be Jagged Grand Armor, Nox Helm, and Gauntlet (or Spiral Spear if you can get it).
